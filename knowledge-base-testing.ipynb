When you first open the app, there are introduction screens that explain the app's features. You can then proceed to accept the End User License Agreement and select your pain conditions and medications during the initial setup process, all before creating an account or logging in.\n",

      "\n",
      "Why isn’t my specific pain condition listed?\n",
      "If you cannot find your specific pain condition listed in the app, you can add a new one by following these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. From the \"Add Pain Condition\" screen, type 3 or more letters of your condition and wait for the search results.\n",
      "2. If your condition is not found in the search results, tap \"ADD CONDITION\".\n",

      "Do I need to include any pain conditions?\n",
      "No, you do not need to add any pain conditions to use the app or get quotes. Adding pain conditions is optional, but providing more information can make the reports more comprehensive for sharing with your care team.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Why are you asking this question?\n",
      "The app asks for personal information like pain conditions, medications, and other details to personalize the app experience for each user. This allows the app to provide more relevant insights, reports, and recommendations tailored to your specific situation and needs.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Am I obligated to add medications?\n",
      "No, you are not obligated to add medications to the app. Adding medications is an optional feature that allows you to track which medications you are taking and their potential impact on your pain levels. If you do not take any medications or prefer not to track them in the app, you can simply skip that section.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Search for your medication name in the app \n",
      "2. If it doesn't show up in the search results, select \"Request It\"\n",

      "What measures do you take to secure my data?\n",
      "Manage My Pain takes several measures to protect your data and privacy, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Data is transmitted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and encrypted credentials\n",
      "- All data is encrypted both in transit and at rest\n",
      "- Access controls and management oversight for system administrative safeguards\n",
      "- Regular security and compliance audits\n",
      "- Daily off-site backups through encrypted channels\n",
      "- Policies and procedures developed by a designated privacy officer\n",
      "- Restricted access to data based on employee roles\n",
      "- Data stored on secure Amazon Web Services (AWS) servers with firewall protection\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Where can I find my activation email?\n",
      "If you don't receive your activation email after registering, please check your Spam or Junk folder. Sometimes the activation emails end up there.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Will you share any of my personal information?\n",
      "No, we will never disclose any of your personal information. We take privacy very seriously and follow guidelines like PIPEDA in Canada and HIPAA in the US to protect your data. Details on how we protect and use your information are outlined in our Privacy Policy.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Will I receive unsolicited emails or spam from you?\n",
      "No, you will not receive any unsolicited emails or spam from us. We never share your email address with anyone. We will only email you for specific actions like changing your password or requesting a report. Occasionally, we may send out an email newsletter, but you will always be able to unsubscribe from it using the link at the bottom of the email.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Is it necessary to create multiple accounts?\n",
      "No, you only need to create one account, and then you can use the same account on all your devices. Your data will be synchronized across all devices where you use the same account.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "When should I log a pain entry?\n",
      "There is no single right time to log a pain entry. The app provides flexibility to log pain entries at different times based on your needs:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. When you receive a notification from the app, typically at 8 PM every day.\n",
      "2. When you start experiencing a pain episode, so you can track details like duration, medications/interventions tried, etc. You can update the entry later once the episode ends.\n",
      "3. At the end of a pain episode, though this requires recalling all details from memory which may be less accurate. It's recommended to log a baseline or constant pain entry daily by selecting \"All Day\" in the Timing section. This creates a 24-hour pain record starting at midnight for accurate tracking of persistent pain levels.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "How can I enter baseline or constant pain data?\n",
      "To add baseline or constant pain, in the \"Timing\" section of the Add/Edit Pain Record screen, there is an option to select \"All Day\". Selecting this will automatically create a pain record that begins at 12AM and lasts for 24 hours. It is recommended to create an \"All Day\" record daily for the most accurate tracking of constant or baseline pain.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Can I assign different ratings for pain in various locations?\n",
      "Yes, you can add different pain ratings for different locations of your body. To do this, you will need to create separate pain record entries for each location that has a different pain rating. Creating separate entries for different pain locations allows the app to accurately track and display the pain ratings for each area in the Results section. This approach is recommended for getting precise pain tracking data.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "What should I do if a specific value is missing?\n",
      "If you can't find a value that you're looking for in the app's lists (such as for symptoms, activities, medications, etc.), you can easily add a custom value. Simply go to the \"Add Pain Record\" or \"Add Daily Reflection\" screen, expand the section you want to customize, and press \"EDIT LIST\". Then you can add the missing value you need.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "How can I log a past record?\n",
      "To log a past pain record in the Manage My Pain app, click the words \"right now\" in the question \"How is your pain right now?\". This will allow you to change the start date and time for the pain record to reflect a time in the past. Alternatively, you can open the Timing section in the Add Pain Record screen and manually change the Start Date and Start Time fields to the desired past date and time when the pain episode began.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "When is it appropriate to update an existing record?\n",
      "Many of our users come back after several hours to update the end time of their pain episode and the effectiveness of the medication and non-medication interventions that they took. You can update an existing pain record by:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Opening the app and going to the \"Recent Records\" card on the home screen or the \"Records\" tab in the Results screen.\n",
      "2. Selecting the record you want to edit.\n",
      "3. Modifying the record details as needed.\n",
      "4. Pressing \"SAVE\" at the bottom to save your changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The app will confirm if the record was successfully updated.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Can I track more than just pain?\n",
      "Yes, you can track a variety of symptoms and conditions beyond just pain using the Manage My Pain app. The app allows you to add custom values to the \"Other Associated Symptoms\" section of a pain record. For example, if you want to track your mood, you can add custom values like \"Mood (anxious)\", \"Mood (happy)\", \"Mood (down)\", etc. and then select the appropriate value when recording your symptoms.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "What if the value I need is not available?\n",
      "If you cannot find the value you need in the pre-populated lists when adding a pain record or daily reflection, you can add a custom value. The app allows you to create and customize lists by adding new values that are relevant to your situation. For example, if you need to specify a symptom or attribute that is not listed, you can add it as a custom value. The app gives you flexibility to track things that are specific to your condition.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "When is the right time to add a daily reflection?\n",
      "You should add a daily reflection closer to the end of your day prior to going to bed. Doing so allows you to reflect on everything you accomplished during the day. You can add a daily reflection in a few ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Press \"ADD DAILY REFLECTION\" on the home screen.\n",
      "2. Click the notification reminder you receive from the app after 6:45 PM if you haven't added a daily reflection yet for that day.\n",
      "3. Go to the \"Add Daily Reflection\" screen directly.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "How do I enter a daily reflection for a previous date?\n",
      "To enter a daily reflection for a previous date:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. On the home screen, long press on the \"Recent Records\" card for the date you want to add a reflection for. Select \"Add Daily Reflection\".\n",
      "\n",
      "2. On the \"Add Daily Reflection\" screen, tap \"Select Date\" and choose the desired past date.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Complete the daily reflection sections and tap \"Save\" when done.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "What happens if I don't add a daily reflection?\n",
      "The Daily Reflection scores are a powerful measurement for you and your healthcare team to understand the impact that pain is having on your life. While information entered into Manage My Pain is voluntary, the more information that is entered, the more powerful the reports can be.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "How can I include a medication in the list?\n",
      "To include a medication in the list:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. On the \"My Profile\" screen, expand the \"Medications\" section and press \"ADD NEW\".\n",
      "2. Search for your medication by typing at least 3 letters of the name. Select it from the list if it appears.\n",
      "3. If your medication is not listed, press \"REQUEST IT\" to send an email to request it be added to the database.\n",
      "4. After selecting the medication, specify details like brand, form, and strength.\n",
      "5. Press \"APPLY CHANGES\" to add the medication to your list.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Why am I unable to find the option I’m looking for?\n",
      "If you cannot find a particular option or value you are looking for in the app, you can usually add it as a custom value. The app allows users to add thousands of personal values to accommodate different situations and preferences. To add a custom value:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Go to the screen where you need to add the custom value (e.g. Add Pain Record, Add Daily Reflection).\n",
      "2. Expand the section you want to customize.\n",
      "3. Scroll down and press \"EDIT LIST\".\n",
      "4. On the \"Edit List\" screen, press \"Add New\" at the bottom.\n",
      "5. Enter the custom value and press \"ADD NEW\".\n",
      "\n",
      "After adding the custom value, it will appear in the list of options for that section.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Will modifying a custom value impact related records?\n",
      "Yes, if you edit an existing custom value, all records that are associated with that value will also be updated. When modifying a custom value, the app will display a confirmation prompt indicating how many records will be affected if you change the value.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Am I required to rate the app when the prompt appears?\n",
      "No, rating the app is optional when the prompt appears. However, providing a rating and review is an important way to help the developers improve the app for you and other users.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "How can I confirm if my records are synchronized?\n",
      "Every time you add a new record in the Manage My Pain app, it will automatically be sent to the server for syncing. If the sync is still pending, a green dot will appear on top of the \"sync\" icon. If the \"sync\" icon turns red, there were problems saving the record to your account. In that case, press the \"sync\" icon to retry syncing your data. If the issue persists, contact support for assistance.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Why can’t I see all of my records?\n",
      "You most likely have a filter applied which should be removed. To see all of your records, go to the \"Results\" or \"Reports\" screen, press the funnel icon to access the Filter Records screen, and then press \"RESET FILTERS\" to remove any applied filters.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Are records older than 30 days still available for free users?\n",
      "Yes, all of your records are still accessible and visible under the \"Records\" tab if you are a free user. The limitation for free users is that Insights, Reports, and Charts are limited to showing only the last 30 days of records.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "How were these reports generated?\n",
      "The reports in the Manage My Pain app were designed in conjunction with a multi-disciplinary pain management team at Canada's largest academic hospital, the University Health Network. The reports are intended to provide a clinically-relevant summary of your pain condition, symptoms, and records to help healthcare professionals quickly understand your situation and make more effective treatment decisions.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "What’s the best way to send my report to my doctor?\n",
      "The best way to share your report with your doctor is to print out the PDF file from the email link provided after generating the report. We recommend bringing the printed report with you to your next clinic visit. Emailing reports is not recommended as it is not a secure form of communication.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "How can I export these visual graphs?\n",
      "You can export visual graphs by generating a report through the app. When generating the report, you have the option to include the Charts, Timeline, and Calendar view sections which contain various visual graphs and charts. However, including these advanced sections in the report requires a credit for non-Pro users.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Why is there a credit charge for generating reports?\n",
      "The basic \"Pain Summary\", \"Patient Profile\", and \"Record Details\" sections of the report do not require credits. Credits are only needed to include the more advanced sections like \"Chart View\", \"Timeline View\", and \"Calendar View\". This allows Lite and Pro version users to generate a full report with these comprehensive sections without having to subscribe. The advanced sections provide more detailed visualizations of the data and are useful for users who need extra documentation to share their condition with new healthcare providers or to support claims. Credits give Lite users the option to generate these full reports on an as-needed basis without paying for the Pro subscription.\n",

      "\n",
      "Where is the option to enter strength in micrograms (mcg)?\n",

However, you can view the effectiveness of your medications from the \"Medications\" card on the home screen or from the \"Insights\" and \"Charts\" tabs under the \"Results\" section. The effectiveness is represented as a percentage breakdown of how you rated each medication as \"Better\", \"Worse\", or \"No Change\" when recording your pain episodes. Additionally, we recommend looking at the trend lines of your pain scores and daily reflection scores since starting a new medication. This can give you an idea of whether the medication has been helping to manage your pain and symptoms over time.\n",

      "\n",
      "Is it possible to add supplements to My Profile?\n",
      "Yes, you can add most supplement ingredients as medications to your profile in the app. For example, you can add \"Vitamin B1 / thiamine\" as a medication.

      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Why do I need to provide extra personal information for my account?\n",
      "The primary purpose for providing additional personal information like your weight, height, birth date, name, country, and gender is so that any reports you generate are more comprehensive and give a fuller picture of your medical history for your care team.\n",

      "\n",
      "When is the best time to set my reminders?\n",
      "The best time to set reminders depends on when you want to record your daily reflections or pain records. The app recommends setting reminders for a time when most of your day's activities are completed. By default, reminders are set for 8 PM, but you can change this to fit your schedule and lifestyle. Any reminder set after 6:45 PM will automatically take you to the \"Add Daily Reflection\" screen when you click on the notification, if you haven't added a daily reflection for that day already. Otherwise, it will take you to the \"Add Pain Record\" screen.\n",

      "What happens if I tap on a reminder notification?\n",
      "If you tap on a reminder notification before 6:45 PM, it will take you to the \"Add Pain Record\" screen so you can log your pain record for the day. However, if you tap on a reminder notification after 6:45 PM and you have not yet logged your daily reflection for that day, it will take you to the \"Add Daily Reflection\" screen instead.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Can I schedule multiple reminders in one day?\n",
      "Yes, you can add multiple reminders in a single day. To add a new reminder, go to the Settings screen by opening the app menu and selecting \"Settings\". Then tap on \"ADD REMINDER\" in the Reminders section. You can set the time, frequency, sound, vibration, and other options for each new reminder you add.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Is it possible to turn off or remove a reminder?\n",
