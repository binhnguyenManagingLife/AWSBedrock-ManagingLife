There could be many potential reasons related to the medication itself, the dosage, interactions with other medications you may be taking, your particular medical condition, etc. The best thing to do is to speak with your prescribing doctor or pharmacist and explain the issues you are having. They will be able to review your full medical details and medication regimen to troubleshoot why the prescription doesn't seem to be having the intended effect. Don't try to adjust the prescription on your own without consulting your doctor first.   \n",
