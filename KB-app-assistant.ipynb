      "Why are you asking this question?\n",

      "- Backing up data daily off-site through an encrypted channel\n",
      "- Implementing privacy procedures with an assigned privacy officer\n",

      "Where can I find my activation email?\n",
      "If you do not receive an activation email after registering for an account with Manage My Pain, please check your spam or junk folder, as sometimes the activation email may end up there. The activation email contains a link that you need to click in order to activate your account.\n",

      "\n",
      "Will you share any of my personal information?\n",

      "Will I receive unsolicited emails or spam from you?\n",
      "No, we never share your email address or send you unsolicited emails or spam. According to the information provided, the app will only email you for specific actions like changing your password or requesting a report.

Your privacy is protected and your email will not be misused or shared.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Is it necessary to create multiple accounts?\n",
      "No, you do not need to create more than one account. The app allows you to use a single account across all your devices, and your data will be synchronized across them.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "When should I log a pain entry?\n",
      "There are a few common times when you should log a pain entry in the app:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. When you receive a notification, which is typically set for 8PM every day. Clicking the notification will take you straight to the \"Add Pain Record\" screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. When you start experiencing a new pain episode. You can add the initial details, then go back later and update the record with more information like duration, alleviating factors, etc. once the episode has ended.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Immediately after a pain episode ends. Adding the record right away allows you to accurately capture when it started, what interventions you tried, and other details while it's still fresh in your mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also log baseline or constant pain by selecting the \"All Day\" option in the Timing section, which will create a 24-hour pain record starting at midnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me know if you need any other details on when or how to log pain entries in the app.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "How can I enter baseline or constant pain data?\n",
      "To add baseline or constant pain, you can select the \"All Day\" option in the Timing section when adding a pain record. This will automatically create a record that begins at 12AM and lasts for 24 hours, allowing you to track your constant or baseline pain level accurately.\n",
      "\n",
      "The instructions state: \"In the Timing section, there is an option to select \"All Day\", which automatically creates a pain record that begins at 12AM and lasts 24 hours. We recommend that you create this record every day for the most accurate Results.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you want to learn more about adding pain records in the app?\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Can I assign different ratings for pain in various locations?\n",
      "Yes, you can assign different pain ratings for various locations in the app. The app allows you to create separate entries for different body locations, so you can rate the pain level for each location independently. This approach helps ensure accurate tracking and reporting of your pain experience.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "What should I do if a specific value is missing?\n",
      "If a specific value is missing from the lists in the app (e.g. medication name, symptom, activity), you can add a custom value to that list. The instructions mention that the app provides a starting list of common values based on clinically-validated sources, but you can add your own custom values if needed. To add a custom value:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Go to the Add Pain Record or Add Daily Reflection screen.\n",
      "2. Expand the section you want to customize by pressing the down arrow.\n",

      "Can I track more than just pain?\n",
      "Yes, you can track things other than just pain using the Manage My Pain app. The app allows you to add custom values to the \"Other Associated Symptoms\" section of a pain record. For example, if you want to track your mood, you can add custom values like \"Mood (anxious)\", \"Mood (happy)\", etc. in that section when recording your pain. This way, you can track other symptoms or factors along with your pain. The app is flexible and allows you to customize the tracking to suit your needs. Do you want to learn more about tracking additional symptoms and details?\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "What if the value I need is not available?\n",
      "If the value you need is not available in the list, the app allows you to add a custom value. Here are the steps:\n",

      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "When is the right time to add a daily reflection?\n",
      "According to the context provided, you should add a daily reflection closer to the end of your day, prior to going to bed. Doing so allows you to reflect on everything you accomplished during the day. The app states that \"You should add a daily reflection closer to the end of your day prior to going to bed. Doing so at this time allows you to reflect on everything you accomplished during the day.\"\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "How do I enter a daily reflection for a previous date?\n",
      "To enter a daily reflection for a previous date, follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Open the app and navigate to the \"Add Record\" screen.\n",
      "\n",

      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "What happens if I don't add a daily reflection?\n",
      "The Daily Reflection scores are an important measurement for you and your healthcare team to understand the impact that pain is having on your life. While entering information in the Manage My Pain app is voluntary, the more data you provide, the more comprehensive and powerful the reports will be. So while not strictly required, adding daily reflections regularly is highly recommended to get the most value out of the app.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "How can I include a medication in the list?\n",
      "To include a medication in the list, you have a few options:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Search for the medication: Type three or more letters of the generic medication name or brand name, and wait for a few seconds. A list of medications will appear. Select the appropriate medication from the list to add it.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Add a new medication: If you can't find the medication in the search results, press \"ADD NEW\". This will take you to the \"Add Medication\" screen where you can search again. If the medication still doesn't appear in the search results, press \"REQUEST IT\". This will open your default email app with pre-filled information so you can send a request to have the medication added to the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Enter medication details: After selecting or adding the medication, you can specify additional details like brand, form, dosage, strength, and the conditions you're taking it for. Be sure to include the start and end dates. Press \"APPLY CHANGES\" to confirm.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The medication will now be included in your list and available to track when adding pain records.\n",

      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Why am I unable to find the option I’m looking for?\n",
      "Here are a few possible reasons why you may be unable to find an option you're looking for in the app:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. It's a custom value that needs to be added manually. The app allows you to add custom values for things like medications, symptoms, etc that are not initially included in the database. To add a new custom value, go to the relevant section, expand it, and select \"Add New\".\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The specific brand/formulation of medication may not be in the database yet. However, you can usually find the active ingredient(s) and select those instead. If the ingredient itself is missing, you can add that as a custom value under \"Interventions\".\n",
      "\n",
      "3. For some less common conditions/symptoms, the app's lists may not have all options covered initially. In that case, you can add missing items as custom values within the relevant section.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The feature you're looking for may not have been implemented yet. The app documentation mentions that some features like medication reminders are still being worked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you've checked all the relevant sections and still can't find what you need, I'd recommend contacting customer support via the \"Contact Us\" option in the app menu. They can look into adding the missing items to the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you want to learn more about adding custom values or reaching out to the support team? Let me know if you need any additional details.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Will modifying a custom value impact related records?\n",
      "Yes, editing a custom value will impact all records that were previously associated with that custom value. When modifying an existing custom value, the app will show a confirmation prompt indicating how many records will be affected before allowing you to proceed with the change.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Am I required to rate the app when the prompt appears?\n",
      "No, rating the app is optional when the prompt appears. However, providing a rating is an important way to help the developers improve the app for you and other users.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "How can I confirm if my records are synchronized?\n",
      "To confirm if your records are synchronized:\n",
      "\n",
      "Every time you add a new record, it will automatically be sent to the server for synchronization. If the sync is still pending, a green dot will appear on top of the \"sync\" icon. This means there are changes that have not yet been saved to your account. \n",
      "\n",
      "To manually force the synchronization, press the \"sync\" icon. If the dot disappears and the icon turns green, your records have been successfully synced.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if the \"sync\" icon remains red after pressing it, there were problems saving the record to your account. In that case, you should contact support for assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you want me to explain the synchronization process in more detail?\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Why can’t I see all of my records?\n",
      "You most likely have a filter applied which is limiting the records you can see. To see all your records, go to the \"Filter Records\" screen and press \"RESET FILTERS\" on the top-right side. This will remove any filters that were previously applied, allowing you to view all your pain records and daily reflections. If you still don't see all your records after resetting the filters, please contact support.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Are records older than 30 days still available for free users?\n",
      "Yes, records older than 30 days are still accessible for free users. While the Insights, Reports, and Charts are limited to the last 30 days for free users, all your records remain available and visible under the Records tab.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "How were these reports generated?\n",
      "These reports were designed in collaboration with a multi-disciplinary pain management team at a major academic hospital. The reports aim to provide summarized and clinically relevant information to help healthcare professionals quickly understand the patient's condition and make more informed treatment or diagnosis decisions. Some key points about the report generation:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The Pain Summary includes 12 cards with graphs, charts, and frequency values summarizing the user's recorded pain data and daily reflections.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The Patient Profile and Record Details sections provide an overview of the user's profile information, conditions, medications, and detailed pain record entries.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Users can customize which sections to include by selecting overlays, sorting options, date ranges, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "- For the free \"Lite\" version, users have access to the basic sections. Advanced sections like Calendar View require purchasing credits.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The reports are designed to present information healthcare providers typically collect from patients during visits, in an organized and shareable format.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall goal is to facilitate better communication and understanding between patients and their care teams regarding their pain condition and management. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "What’s the best way to send my report to my doctor?\n",
      "The best way to share your report with your doctor is to print it out and bring it with you to your next clinical visit. The app recommends against emailing the report, as that is not a secure form of communication.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "How can I export these visual graphs?\n",
      "All graphs, including the timeline and calendar views, are available as sections in the Reports. However, please note that if you wish to include the Charts, Timeline, or Calendar views in the report, it will require a credit from a paid subscription.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Why is there a credit charge for generating reports?\n",
      "According to the information provided, there is a credit charge for generating reports that include certain advanced sections, such as Charts, Timeline View, or Calendar View. The reasoning is:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The most commonly used section needed by healthcare professionals is the \"Summary\", which does not require a credit.\n",
      "- Credits are a way for \"Lite\" users to generate more comprehensive reports without having to purchase the full \"Pro\" version of the app.\n",
      "- It is also a way for the app developers to continue supporting and providing the more detailed advanced sections, which are only needed by a small segment of users.\n",
      "\n",
      "So in summary, the credit charge applies only if you want to include the advanced visualization sections in your report. The basic sections like Pain Summary, Patient Profile, and Record Details can be included for free. The credit system allows flexibility for users who only occasionally need the advanced reporting features.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you want me to provide any additional details on the credit system for reports?\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Why am I missing some of my records?\n",
      "You're most likely missing some of your records because you have a filter applied that is hiding certain records. The app allows you to filter your records based on various criteria like timing, severity, pain conditions, etc. To view all your records:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Go to the \"Records\" or \"Reports\" tab in the app.\n",
      "2. Tap the \"funnel\" icon on the top right to access the Filter Records screen.\n",
      "3. On the Filter Records screen, tap \"RESET FILTERS\" to remove any applied filters. \n",
      "\n",
      "This will clear any filters you had set, allowing you to see all your pain records and daily reflections.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you still don't see certain records after resetting filters, you may want to check that you have not accidentally deleted or edited those records. Let me know if you need any other help!\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "What are the benefits of including the advanced sections in the report?\n",
      "The more comprehensive sections like the Charts, Timeline, and Calendar views provide additional details and visual representations of your pain information. This can be useful when:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Explaining your condition for the first time to a new healthcare provider. The visuals give them a clearer picture of your symptoms and how they have progressed over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "- You need more documentation to support a claim or case related to your condition. The advanced sections provide greater detail than just the summary section.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many users find these extra views helpful to better communicate the full scope of their condition. They provide insight that may not be obvious from the summary cards alone. Do you want to learn more about generating reports with the advanced sections?\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "How do I export all my data?\n",
      "Unfortunately the app does not currently offer the ability to export your data to CSV or any other raw data format. The only way to export your data is by generating a report from within the app. I would suggest generating a comprehensive report that includes all sections like the Charts, Timeline, Calendar, etc. to get a complete record of your data that can then be printed or shared. Let me know if you need any help on how to generate a report with all your information.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "How often will I need to buy credits?\n",
      "Credits are only needed if you wish to generate a report that includes the more comprehensive sections like Charts, Timeline View, or Calendar. For Lite users, credits are also required to include records older than 30 days in the report. Pro Subscribers do not need credits to generate full reports with advanced sections or include older records.\n",
      "\n",
      "The frequency of purchasing credits depends on how often you need to generate reports with those advanced sections. If you plan to generate many such reports, subscribing to the Pro plan may be more cost-effective. Do you want to learn more about credits and subscription plans?\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Which version or subscription plan would suit me best?\n",
      "When choosing a subscription plan, consider your needs and how frequently you may need to generate full reports with advanced analytics and insights. The app offers two main options:\n",
      "\n",
      "Lite Version (Free):\n",
      "- Allows you to log symptoms, track medications, and access basic features\n",
      "- Requires purchasing report credits to generate full reports with advanced sections\n",
      "\n",
      "Pro Subscription:\n",
      "- Provides unlimited access to generate full reports with advanced analytics and insights, without needing to purchase report credits\n",
      "- Offers a convenient monthly or yearly subscription model\n",
      "\n",
      "To decide, ask yourself how often you anticipate needing detailed reports and data analysis. If you only need occasional reports, the free Lite version with purchasing credits as needed may suffice. However, if you require regular in-depth reporting, the Pro Subscription could be more cost-effective in the long run.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you want me to explain further about the subscription options and pricing? I'm happy to provide additional details to help you assess which plan may be the best fit.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",

      "1. Go to the \"My Profile\" section and expand the \"Medications\" section.\n",
      "2. Find the medication you want to edit and press the three vertical dots icon next to it.\n",

      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",

      "Currently, the app does not have the functionality to set reminders specifically for taking medication. The reminders in the app are only used to record your pain levels and create daily reflections. However, the app developers are still working on implementing medication reminders as a future feature. For now, you will need to rely on other methods (e.g. setting an alarm on your phone) to remind yourself to take your medications.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Where is the option to enter strength in micrograms (mcg)?\n",
      "The standard unit for micrograms is actually µg. When entering the strength of your medication, please select the µg option from the list.\n",

      "\n",
      "What should I do if my medication isn't listed?\n",
      "If your medication is not listed in the app, you can add it by following these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Press the \"ADD NEW\" button when adding or editing your medications.\n",

      "2. In the search field, type at least the first 3 letters of the generic medication name or brand name and wait a few seconds. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. If your medication does not appear in the search results, select \"REQUEST IT\".\n",

      "4. This will open your default email app with pre-filled information to request that your medication be added to the database. Simply send the email.\n",
      "\n",
      "The app developers will then work on adding your requested medication to their database so you can track it properly. If you need any clarification or have additional questions, feel free to ask. Do you want to learn more about adding medications to your profile?\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "How does the app notify me if the medication is effective?\n",
      "The app does not directly notify you if a medication is effective or not. However, you can view the effectiveness of your medications by looking at the trend lines of your pain scores and daily reflection scores since starting the medication. Specifically:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Go to the \"Results\" screen and select the \"Charts\" tab. \n",
      "2. Use the dropdown menu to select \"Ineffective Factors\" and \"Alleviating Factors\". \n",
      "3. This will show you charts indicating which factors, including medications, have helped alleviate or worsen your pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, on the \"Medications\" card on the home screen, there is a percentage breakdown showing how often each medication was marked as \"Better\", \"Worse\", or \"No Change\" when logging your pain records.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while the app does not explicitly notify you, it provides visualizations and data to help you track and analyze the effectiveness of each medication over time. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Is it possible to add supplements to My Profile?\n",
      "Yes, you can add most supplements and vitamins to your profile in the Manage My Pain app. The instructions mention that most supplement ingredients can be added as a medication. Specifically, it states:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Most ingredients in supplements can be added as a Medication. For example, you can add 'Vitamin B1 / thiamine' to your profile. If you don't find an ingredient you're looking for, drop us a line.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So you should be able to search for and add things like vitamin B1, vitamin C, calcium, etc. to track them as medications in your profile. If you can't find a specific ingredient, you can request for it to be added by contacting the app support.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Why do I need to provide extra personal information for my account?\n",
      "The extra personal information you provide for your account is primarily to make the reports generated by the app more comprehensive and provide a fuller picture of your medical history for your care team.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you want to learn more details about the \"About Me\" section where you can add this additional personal information?\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",

      "What languages does the app support?\n",
      "The app supports 7 languages: English, French, German, Spanish, Russian, Korean, and Simplified Chinese. According to the information provided, the app offers full language support across all aspects including intake, user support, and the user interface itself for those 7 languages.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "When is the best time to set my reminders?\n",
      "We recommend that you set your reminders for a time when the majority of your day's activities are completed. The app defaults reminders to 8PM, but you can change this to better fit your specific lifestyle and schedule.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Can I set a reminder for taking my medication?\n",
      "No, currently the app does not have the functionality to set reminders for taking medications. The reminder feature is only used to record your pain and/or create a daily reflection. The response states:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Currently, the reminders are only used to record your pain and/or create a daily reflection. We are still working on implementing medication reminders.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the app does allow you to track your medication consumption when recording a pain entry, including documenting the impact the medication had on your pain levels. To learn more details on tracking medications, I'd be happy to provide those instructions.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "What happens if I tap on a reminder notification?\n",
      "When you tap on a reminder notification from the Manage My Pain app, it will take you to one of two places depending on the time:\n",
      "\n",
      "If the notification is after 6:45 PM and you have not recorded a daily reflection yet for that day, tapping the notification will take you to the \"Add Daily Reflection\" screen to allow you to record your daily reflection.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the notification is before 6:45 PM, or if you have already recorded your daily reflection for the day, tapping the notification will take you to the \"Add Pain Record\" screen to allow you to log a new pain record.\n",
      "\n",
      "The notifications are designed to remind you to either log your pain or record your daily reflection based on the typical schedule and flow of using the app.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Can I schedule multiple reminders in one day?\n",
      "Yes, you can add multiple reminders in a day. According to the context provided, you can go to the Settings section of the app, press \"ADD REMINDER\", and set up additional reminders for different times of the day. The instructions state:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go to settings, press \"ADD REMINDER\". To read the detailed step-by-step guide on how to add a reminder, press here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So the app allows you to schedule multiple reminders, and you can follow the steps to add as many as you need within the same day.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Is it possible to turn off or remove a reminder?\n",
