       "['By tracking your pain, you can learn when to expect a flare-up and how to manage to get through it or even avoid it altogether.   Tracking can reduce your anxiety as you gain more control over your pain.   Flare-ups can be triggered by different aggravating factors, like changes in weather, stress, or activity levels. Each person with pain has their own unique aggravating factors.   Some factors, like the weather, are not easy to control. But, knowing that they are your triggers can help you to plan ahead to manage the flare-up. Other factors are easier to control. For example, for many people, stress can cause a flare-up. When you feel that your level of stress is increasing, you can focus on managing the stress so it doesn’t trigger a flare-up.   By paying attention to what happens around a flare-up and tracking it over time, you can reduce some of the anxiety of living with chronic pain. Reducing anxiety can also help to prevent flare-ups and improve daily functioning.

Many of our users come back after several hours to update the end time of their pain episode and the effectiveness of the medication and non-medication interventions that they took. ### Can I track things other than pain? Given the flexibility within Manage My Pain, you can track anything else you wish.  The best way to do this is to add custom values to the \"Other Associated Symptoms\" section of a pain record.  For example, if you wish to track various moods, add custom values to the \"Other Associated Symptoms\" section such as: Mood (anxious), Mood (apathetic), Mood (happy), Mood (down)  When you record your pain, you can then select the value that best captures your mood. ## 4.
