It states that the energy of particles or systems can only take on certain specific values, rather than varying continuously.\\n\\nSome key points about discrete energies:\\n\\n- Particles like electrons can only exist in specific, discrete energy levels around the nucleus rather than any arbitrary energy level.\\n\\n- When an electron transitions between allowed energy levels, it absorbs or emits a quantum of energy with very specific values corresponding to the energy difference between the levels.\\n\\n- This quantization of energy is observed at the atomic and subatomic scales and contrasts with classical physics, which views energy as continuous.\\n\\n- The allowed discrete energy levels depend on the specific system, like an atom, molecule or particle. Each system has its own unique set of quantized energy levels.\\n\\n- The quantization arises fundamentally from the wave-particle duality of matter and the uncertainty principle in quantum theory.\\n\\nSo in essence, quantum mechanics reveals that energy at small scales is quantized into discrete packets or quanta, rather than being a smooth, continuous quantity. This discreteness leads to many unique quantum phenomena like atomic spectra and quantum jumps.'}],\n",
